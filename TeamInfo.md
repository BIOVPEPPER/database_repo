## Project Summary

“Cheaper by the Dozen” - this is a wellknown fact we encounter everyday going groceries:
buying in bigger packages is much cheaper per unit of good. But what if one doesn’t need a dozen but still wants to buy things cheaper? No need to search for friends that can share the price with you. Care2Share web-application does that for you. Make a wishlist of groceries, enter the quantity you need, match up with other people and benefit from affordable prices!
